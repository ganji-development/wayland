 * IPC bridge allowlist (C1 hardening).
 *
 * The preload contract (`electronAPI.emit`) forwards arbitrary (name, data)
 * tuples from the renderer into the main-process bridge emitter. Without an
 * allowlist, a renderer XSS could call dangerous providers directly
 * (fs.writeFile, fs.removeEntry, shell.openExternal, etc.).
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for which event names are
 * permitted to cross the renderer→main boundary. It works by wrapping the
 * platform's `bridge.buildProvider` / `bridge.buildEmitter` factories: every
 * declared key is recorded here at module-load time, and only those keys
 * (with their `subscribe-` / `subscribe.callback-` wire prefixes) are
 * accepted by the inbound dispatcher.
 *
 * Wire-protocol shape (see @office-ai/platform):
 *   - provider invocation: renderer → main as `subscribe-<key>`
 *   - provider response  : main → renderer as `subscribe.callback-<key><id>`
 *     (renderer-side providers reverse this - see RENDERER_PROVIDED_KEYS)
 *   - emitter event      : main → renderer as `<key>` (renderer never
 *     re-emits these inbound)
 *
 * A small set of constant control names (heartbeat, auth) is also allowed.
