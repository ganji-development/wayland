 * where credentials and prompts are sent. A pre-placed or sibling-written config
 * must never inject or keep a provider override the app did not author, or an
 * attacker with workspace write access could redirect traffic to their own host
 * (RT-B6-07).
 *
 * We parse with a real TOML library rather than scanning lines, because TOML
 * exposes the same `providers` table through many equivalent syntaxes -
 * bracket header `[providers.openai]`, inline table
 * `providers = { openai = { ... } }`, dotted key `providers.openai.base_url`,
 * spaced dotted `providers . openai . base_url`, quoted-key header
 * `["providers"]`, headers with trailing comments - and a string scan cannot
 * robustly catch them all. Parsing collapses every form into the single
 * top-level `providers` object key, so one `delete` strips every variant.
 *
 * The app's own provider fragment (`appContent`) is parsed and its `providers`
 * (plus any other app-owned top-level keys) merged over the sanitized user
 * object, so the app's values always win. Legitimate user-authored non-provider
 * settings (top-level keys, other tables) are preserved.
 *
 * Fails closed: if the existing file is not valid TOML (malformed / attacker
 * garbage), the user content is discarded entirely and only the app's
