 *
 * Reports on route change and whenever this window regains focus (a conversation
 * can be popped out into its own window; the focused window re-asserts its own
 * chat, so the single main-process value always reflects the focused window).
 *
 * Every report is gated on this window actually having focus. A pop-out loads
 * hidden and mounts (firing effects) BEFORE it is shown/focused, and a window can
 * be navigated programmatically while unfocused — without the guard, a background
 * window's mount/navigation would clobber the foreground value the focused window
 * set. It deliberately does NOT clear on blur: when no window is focused the
 * notifier already falls back to "not watching", and clearing would race the
 * focus of the window being switched to.
