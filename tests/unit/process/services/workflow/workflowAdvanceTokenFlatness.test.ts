/**
 * #986 (follow-up to #723): per-step model input must stay FLAT as the step
 * count grows.
 *
 * The original bug was invisible - a workflow produced correct output and
 * simply cost a fortune, because each advance was sent into the SAME live
 * backend session, which replayed turns 1..N-1 to the model on step N. Nothing
 * failed and nothing errored; only the bill moved. Behavioural tests stay green
 * through that regression by construction, so this file is a MEASUREMENT gate:
 * it runs a multi-step workflow and asserts the per-step input does not grow
 * with the step index.
 *
 * What "flat" means concretely here. On a wcore advance,
 * `sendWorkflowAdvanceDirective` passes `skipCache: true` (which kills the
 * engine process and drops its accumulated 1..N-1 context) plus
 * `workflowResetSeed: WORKFLOW_RESET_SEED_BOUND`. On respawn,
 * `WCoreManager.start()` reseeds the fresh session with
 * `composeResetSeed(persistedMessages, workflowResetSeed)`, which under
 * `priorTurnOnly` carries ONLY the immediately-prior turn, head-clipped to
 * `priorTurnMaxChars`. So the persisted transcript grows linearly with N while
 * the model's input per step is bounded by a constant. Both reseed branches are
 * O(1) in N; that constant-ness is what is asserted.
 *
 * The engine is faked, but the two things that decide the answer are REAL: the
 * production `sendWorkflowAdvanceDirective` chooses the options, and the
 * production `composeResetSeed` computes the reseed. The fake only models the
 * one engine property that matters - a respawn drops context, a reuse keeps it.
 * Remove the reset from the production ternary and these assertions go red.
