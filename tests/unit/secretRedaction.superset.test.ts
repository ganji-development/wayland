/**
 * #992 moved the ~10 remote-facing config-write routes off their own scrubber
 * and onto the shared one. That is only safe if the shared set masks a SUPERSET
 * of what the deleted set masked. The first attempt asserted exactly that in a
 * code comment and was wrong on two shapes:
 *
 *  - a `{8,}` floor on the Bearer pattern where the deleted one had `+`, so
 *    `Authorization: Bearer x` reached the remote client verbatim;
 *  - a trailing `\b` on the `xox`/`xai` patterns. The `xox` class excludes `_`,
 *    so a token followed by `_` could not satisfy the boundary, backtracking
 *    exhausted the `{8,}` floor, and the token survived ENTIRELY.
 *
 * A comment cannot fail CI. This does.

 * shapes; it is structurally blind to a boundary bug on the GitHub, AWS or
 * Google patterns, and those had one.
 *
 * The rule: a trailing `\b` on a token pattern is safe only if the character
 * class contains every word character. Where it does not - `xox` and `gh*_`
 * omit `_`, `AKIA` omits `_` and lowercase - a token followed by a word
 * character produces no word/non-word transition, the boundary fails, and
 * backtracking either falls under the length floor or (for a FIXED length) does
 * not exist at all. The whole token escapes.

 * Rather than pin the three known instances, assert the property over every
 * shape in the corpus. A new pattern added with a trailing anchor fails here.
